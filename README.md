# 🎶 From Notes to Harmony: An Insight into Musical Theory

### 📚 Overview
**From Notes to Harmony** is an educational piano software designed to bridge the gap between musical performance and theoretical understanding.  
It provides a foundational framework for learning **scales, chords, and harmonic progressions**, offering users both **theoretical explanations** and **interactive practice exercises**.

Many musicians, despite years of instrumental training, struggle to connect their technical ability with theoretical knowledge. This project seeks to address that educational shortfall by combining intuitive visual learning tools with structured theory lessons.  

Presented at the **International Conference on Digital Developments (ICDD)**, *From Notes to Harmony* highlights how computer-assisted instruction can deepen a musician’s interpretative skills, creativity, and overall musical proficiency.

### 💡 Motivation
The project was born out of the recognition that **music theory education often lags behind practical training**.  
As Beethoven once said, *“To play a wrong note is insignificant; to play without passion is inexcusable.”*  
By nurturing a strong theoretical foundation, this software aims to ignite that passion and strengthen the connection between **knowledge and expression** in music.

### 🧠 Educational Contribution
*From Notes to Harmony* reimagines the way music theory is taught by integrating:
- **Structured theoretical content** with **practical exercises**
- **Interactive visualization** for immediate comprehension  
- **Pedagogical strategies** designed to make complex concepts accessible  

The project emphasizes that a **robust understanding of theory** not only enhances technical proficiency but also deepens **artistic interpretation and creativity**.  

As Igor Stravinsky noted, *“I haven’t understood a bar of music in my life, but I have felt it.”*  
This project seeks to **bridge understanding and feeling**, allowing musicians to experience harmony both intellectually and emotionally.
